# Week-2---473
This is the second week of my Violet Python class 
this week includes two different assignments 

The first assignment focuses on enhancing my  Python scripting skills for file processing, emphasizing string handling and set operations. while being tasked with modifying a base script to process a text file, specifically to identify and handle occurrences of specific words efficiently.

The second assignment is aimed at developing a Python script for calculating and organizing file MD5 hashes. It requires using the os library to traverse directories, identify files, and compute their hashes.
